## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A MongoDB Atlas account for database management

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/nakul6686/Blogs-Server.git`.
   
2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the cloned repository folder and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
   
3. **Set Up MongoDB**
   - Create a database in MongoDB Atlas and obtain your connection string.
   
4. **Environment Variables**
   - In the root of your project, create a `.env` file and include the following:
     ```
     DB_URL_STRING=YourMongoDBConnectionString
     PORT=YourPreferredPortNumber
     ```
   
5. **Start the Server**
   - Execute `npm start` to run the server. The console should display a message indicating that the server is running and connected to MongoDB.

6. **Testing API Endpoints**
   - Use Postman or any other API testing tool to interact with the API endpoints. Ensure you set `Content-Type: application/json` in the headers for requests that require a body payload.

## API Endpoints Overview
